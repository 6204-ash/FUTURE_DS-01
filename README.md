## ✅ Task 2: Marketing Campaign Insight Analysis  
*Objective:* Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and customer spending patterns.  

*Key Insights:*  
1. *Accepted Campaigns* – Campaign 2 & 4 had the highest acceptance (~25% each).  
2. *Purchases* – Store purchases dominate (39%), followed by web & catalog.  
3. *Spending by Education* – Graduates are the biggest spenders, especially on *wines & meat products*.  
4. *Income vs Spending* – Strong positive correlation: higher income = higher spending.  
5. *Trends* – Income peaked in *Q1 2013*, but complaints increased, leading to reduced spending later.

# 🎓 Student Feedback Analysis

This project is part of my **Data Science & Analytics Internship Task 3**.  
The goal is to analyze student feedback collected after college events/courses and identify strengths and areas for improvement.

---

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- **student_feedback.csv** → Raw dataset (ratings from students)  
- **student_feedback_analysis.ipynb** → Jupyter/Colab Notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations  
- *(This README file)* → Explanation and summary  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- ✅ **Highest rated aspect:** *Explains concepts in an understandable way* (avg ≈ X.X)  
- ⚠️ **Lowest rated aspect:** *Degree of difficulty of assignments* (avg ≈ 5.4)  
- 📌 **Overall average satisfaction:** ≈ X.X / 10  
- 🔎 Correlation analysis shows that students rated each aspect independently (low correlation values).  

---

## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Bar chart → Average rating per feedback category  
- Heatmap → Correlation between feedback questions  
- Distribution plots → Spread of ratings for each question  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Google Colab** for running the notebook  

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Continue focusing on **subject knowledge and clarity of explanations** (students rated these highly).  
- Work on **structuring of the course** and reducing the **difficulty of assignments** to improve student satisfaction.  
- Collect **open-text feedback** in future surveys for deeper insights (e.g., word cloud, sentiment analysis).
